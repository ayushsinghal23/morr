## How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
     Firstly, I imaginary divided the page into numerous components and evaluated the prototype as the viable solution and then researched on naming standards of javascript functions,variables and css classes and ids etc. After that i looked into technical aspects of how functionalities of a particular component can be achieved and researched on google for its various solutions and used a method which abides with the time line alotted to me. then after creating the basic styling, coming to CSS , I researched on the color schemes used in the demo given and the font style used and then wrote responsive CSS.


## Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

 I wanted to use api for filtering series and movies but it was the frontend challenge so I decided to use filtering of JSON feed.


## What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
  
  - I would have also created a page decided to each series or movie in which more info about a particular movie or series can be rendered.
  - I would also look for any further possible optimizations in the code.
